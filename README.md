  ## Introduction
As part of the #Google Data Analytics Professional Certification [https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics], I completed the capstone case study. In this case study, I was given a real-world data analysis scenario for the fictional bike sharing company Cyclistic. This study presented a practical data analysis situation involving the fictional bike-sharing company, Cyclistic. Assuming the role of a junior data analyst on the Cyclistic marketing team, my responsibility was to examine historical data from the company to address a specific business question. I adhered to Google's data analysis framework, which includes the steps of 'ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act' to conduct my analysis. Below is a detailed overview of each step in the process.
  ## Background
  
  ## Approach/Steps
   1. Ask phase
   2. Prepare phase
   3. Process phase (Download all 12 months and export to excel, ckecked for duplicates or mistake, created column for days of the week and ride length)
   4. Analyze phase (SQL queries, I merged all 12 months, cleaned the data, created column for month)
   5. Share phase (PowerBi) then also answer the question regarding similarities and differences between casual riders and annual members.
   6. Act phase (Reccomendation)
